For the past 2 years, Toby has been an outstanding team lead for the Storage Engineering team.  As technical lead for the team, he has become a trusted voice in helping several teams (namely Delivery, Database Engineering and Search) navigate issues and concerns around storage solutions.  He has also worked with Software Engineering with developing a process to automate list restores to alleviate the toil previously encountered in that process.   I like to share this burb one of his colleagues provided as feedback recently: "Toby is a consummate systems engineer.  His knowledge of *nix, server hardware, shell scripting, and attention to detail is unmatched here at Mailchimp.".
